	- Use at least two MVC Area in your project (e.g. for administration)
	- Create tables with data with server-side paging and sorting for every model entity
	- You can use Kendo UI Grid or generate your own HTML tables
	- Adapt the default ASP.NET MVC site template from Visual Studio 2013 or get another free theme
	- Use responsive design based on Twitter Bootstrap
	- You may change the standard theme and modify it to apply own web design and visual styles

	- Use AJAX form and/or SignalR communication in some parts of your application
	- Write unit tests for your logic, controllers, actions, helpers, etc.
	- Apply error handling and data validation to avoid crashes when invalid data is entered (both client-side and server-side)
	- Handle correctly the special HTML characters and tags like <br />
	- Use Ninject (or any other dependency container) and Automapper
	- Use proper architecture for your application

####Public Part

The public part of your projects should be visible without authentication. This public part could be the application start page, the user login and user registration forms, as well as the public data of the users, e.g. the blog posts in a blog system, the public offers in a bid system, the products in an e-commerce system, etc.
Private Part (User Area)
Registered users should have personal area in the Web application accessible after successful login. This area could hold for example the user's profiles management functionality, the user's offers in a bid system, the user's posts in a blog system, the user's photos in a photo sharing system, the user's contacts in a social network, etc.

####Administration Part

System administrators should have administrative access to the system and permissions to administer all major information objects in the system, e.g. to create / edit / delete users and other administrators, to edit / delete offers in a bid system, to edit / delete photos and album in a photo sharing system, to edit / delete posts in a blogging system, edit / delete products and categories in an e-commerce system, etc.
